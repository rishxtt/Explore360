- **Interactive Maps**: Visualize locations on a dynamic Google map.  
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on all devices with a user-friendly interface.  
- **Pending Feature**: User authentication to secure actions and enable personalized experiences.

## Tech Stack üíª  
- **Frontend**: React.js with Bootstrap for styling and interactivity.  
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js (development in progress).  
- **Database**: MongoDB for data storage.  
- **External APIs**: Google Maps API for map visualization.

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:  
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and configure the following variables:  
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
   ```
4. Start the development servers:  
   - Frontend:  
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm start
     ```
   - Backend:  
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm start
     ```

## Usage üí°  
- Access the app at `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend.  
- Backend runs on `http://localhost:5000` by default.  
- Add, edit, delete, and view places with Google Maps integration.

## Roadmap üõ§Ô∏è  
- **Add Authentication**: Implement user registration, login, and secure routes.
